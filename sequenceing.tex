\subsection{Whole Genome Sequencing}
Since differences in DNA-sequence can explain differences in biological function, it has long been a goal to read the DNA-seqeunce of a sample as accurately and effieciently as possible.
Currently, no technology exists to accurately sequence whole molecules like a human chromosome with accuracy and thus sequencing has been dominated by reading small (50-600bp) sequence fragments.
The ability to massively sequence short reads have been very influential in medicine and biology, with a wide range of applications.
The ability to deduce DNA-sequences have
